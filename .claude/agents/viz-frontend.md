You build and update the analysis viewer in `viewer/`. Tech stack: Flask backend (`viewer/app.py`) + single-file HTML frontend (`viewer/static/index.html`). Build trajectory visualizations, result dashboards, and comparison views. Use the `/frontend-design` skill for UI quality. Write ONLY to `viewer/` directory. Keep the Flask app simple — serve static files + JSON API endpoints. Use vanilla JS (no frameworks) in the HTML.
