# Survey Literature

Systematically search and synthesize relevant literature for a research question. Outputs a structured survey document.

## Agent Routing

Read `<plugin-root>/references/agent-routing.md` before delegating. Resolve
`<plugin-root>` by going up two directories from this `SKILL.md`.

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked with `<topic>`:

### Step 1: Gather research context

Read the following files if they exist (skip silently if not found):
- `docs/papers/landscape.md` — user's existing literature map
- `exp/summary.md` — user's experiment history

### Step 2: Run the `domain-expert` role

Follow the portable routing contract with
`<plugin-root>/agents/domain-expert.md`, using this task:

> **Mode 5: Literature Survey**
>
> Research question: {topic}
>
> Research context:
> - Literature landscape: {landscape.md content or "not available"}
> - Experiment history: {exp/summary.md content or "not available"}
>
> Execute your full survey pipeline: Scope → Search → Filter → Synthesize → Output → Update landscape.md.
> Write the survey to `docs/papers/{slugified-topic}-survey.md`.

### Step 3: Report results

After domain-expert completes, tell the user:
- Path to the generated survey file
- Number of papers found
- Any coverage limitations encountered
- Suggest using LabMate's `read-paper` skill to deep-dive any paper from the
  survey.
